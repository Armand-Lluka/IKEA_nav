Please take a look at our website https://www.ikea.com/at/de/

 

Write a short concept paper (PDF) with answering following questions and add all necessary information (description, estimated timeframe for development, scribbles, mock-ups, etc.) incl. your written code (within PDF or online).

 

## What is the most important thing you want to develop first? 
  I propose implementing a fixed search-bar in the navigation menu, that doesn't redirect you to a different page, across all pages on the IKEA website. The goal of this is to reduce the amount of clicks a user needs to get from the landing page to the product they want.
  
  When users first arrive on the landing page of any website they will geneally immediately notice a navigation bar with a list of the different sections

This is normally fine when a user is familar with the user-interface of your specific website, and have somewhat of an understanding on how to get where they want. However a user who is not familiar with the different categories the item they want might fall in will have to invest more time. No matter how perfect the a sites navigation, some will not want to learn it, for these users a search box from every page will be very important. 


On the current version of the IKEA website there is a search button already, the issue with this is that it redirects you to another page, and one click further from where the user wants to go.

### Timeframe

Without knowing much about the codebase nd how the current search system is implemented it would be hard to predict a time to implement this change, however i think it could be done in about a week. depending on things like functionallity(unit) testing and possibly user testing? 
<!-- ### Why? -->


### kind of business impact do you expect?

I expect there to be an overall improvement in the user journey from every page of the website. The direct impact will be: 
1. Fewer clicks for the user to get from one page to the next
2. More time spent looking at the product and not having to deal with UI
3. Theoretically more purchases due to having an easier time going from one order(or page) to the next. 
4. If succesfull might allow cleaning up of other cluttered navigation lists.


### How will you measure the business impact?
1. Measure user retention from one page to the next
2. If the amount of users lost from the first page is less with a searchbox in the navbar, it can be considered a success. 
3. See if the increase traffic in other pages leads to more purchases.
